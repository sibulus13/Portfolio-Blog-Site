          I spend my free time as an explorer, learner, and action enthusiast.
          When traveling, you can find me out and about learning different
          cultures and appreciating new sceneries while checking out new
          restaurants and cafes along the way.

          When home, I am usually motorcycling to a mountain for a hike in the
          summer, or snowboarding in the winter with a cozy bowl of ramen to end
          off my day.
